The tool pointed out the differances in the hole line, but i had to keep comparing each
character on the line

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

This will enable me to be confident about new changes, in other words i can at any time rollback to the older version if my new changes casues any problems.
In teamwork this has a great benefit, i can check to see the history of a certain file
and point a point in time when someone did a change that i need to understand

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manually: Gives me more control, create meaningful commites
Auto: Make sure that every thing is commited

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because changes in multiple files could be a part from the same feature

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log: will allow me to view all the history and choose the one that i'm interested on
git diff: will then allow me to compare two versions that i'm interested on

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Very confident

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For using it as source control where i can contribute to open source projects or my day to day work or even to maintain my own code
