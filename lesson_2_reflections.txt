What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Mark this folder to be tracked from now on
- Without creating a repository no changes will be tracked

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- Staging area is just a place where we add related files to be commited in a single commit
- Working directory is the place where all the files in the directory are considerd
- Repository is what allow git to keep track of the staging area and the working dir

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By running git status command
